# Invitation_Tutorial
I am working my way through PRO ASP.NET MVC 5 so that I can learn MVC to expand my knowledge in Web Technologies, 
ultimately increasing my usefulness to "the company".  

My main focus is to learn all that I can so that I can write code efficiently, I love writing code but find
that I keep finding things that I don't know how to do.  I would feel better if I knew more.

So here I am, Learning More!
